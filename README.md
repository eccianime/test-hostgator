This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation Instructions

Copy this line
https://github.com/eccianime/test-hostgator.git

Create a new folder and on a terminal write as follows:

### `git clone https://github.com/eccianime/test-hostgator.git`

Then, go to the folder that is created and in here write

### `yarn install`

or

### `npm install`

When all is finished, write

### `yarn start`

And this command runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

I also included a build folder which I used to see the working build in a production environment. You can see it here:
